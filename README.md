# Database Games

App for Windows 10 written in C# using WinUI3 libraries.

### What does the app do?

App to manage databases in json format of various gaming platforms. With it I support other applications that I have developed:
* [pepeizq's Steam Connect](https://pepeizqapps.com/app/steam-connect/)
* [pepeizq's Tiles for Games](https://pepeizqapps.com/app/tiles-for-games/)
* [pepeizq's Widgets for Games](https://pepeizqapps.com/app/widgets-for-games/)
